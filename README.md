This repository PHP Shopping Cart contains all the necessary code to set up a functional shopping cart for an e-commerce website.
The cart is built using PHP, allowing for easy integration with any existing PHP-based website.

The codebase includes features such as:

- Adding and removing items from the cart
- Updating item quantities
- Calculating and displaying the total cost of the cart

To get started, make sure you have PHP installed on your system. Then, clone the repository and run composer install to install the necessary dependencies. 
You will also need to configure the database settings in the `DB.php` file inside `inc` folder before running the application.
